**Machine Learning Pipeline Automation Package**

**Overview**

This package provides a comprehensive solution for automating machine learning pipelines, streamlining the process of data preparation, model training, and deployment. It simplifies the workflow by encapsulating complex tasks into modular components, allowing users to focus on high-level decision-making and model optimization.

**Key Features**

1. **Data Ingestion**: Supports various data sources, including CSV, JSON, and database connections. Users can easily import and preprocess data using built-in functions for data cleaning, feature scaling, and data splitting.
2. **Model Selection**: Offers a range of machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Users can choose a pre-trained model or use a custom model implementation.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Provides tools for hyperparameter optimization using grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. This ensures that models are properly configured for optimal performance.
4. **Model Deployment**: Enables seamless deployment of trained models to various environments, including cloud services, containerization, and on-premise infrastructure.
5. **Model Monitoring**: Offers capabilities for monitoring model performance in production, including metrics tracking, logging, and alerting.

**Implementation Details**

To get started with this package, follow these steps:

1. **Install the package**: Run `pip install ml_pipeline_automation` in your terminal.
2. **Import the package**: Add `import ml_pipeline_automation as mlp` to your Python script.
3. **Configure the pipeline**: Create a pipeline configuration file (e.g., `pipeline_config.json`) to define the data sources, model selection, and deployment settings.

**Example Pipeline Configuration File**
```json
{
    "data": {
        "source": "csv",
        "path": "data/train.csv"
    },
    "model": {
        "type": "random_forest",
        "hyperparameters": {
            "n_estimators": 100,
            "max_depth": 5
        }
    },
    "deployment": {
        "environment": "cloud",
        "platform": "aws"
    }
}
```

**Code Generation**

To use the package in your code, follow these examples:

**Data Ingestion**
```python
from ml_pipeline_automation import DataIngestion

# Create a data ingestion object
ingestion = DataIngestion("data/train.csv", "csv")

# Preprocess the data
data = ingestion.preprocess()
```

**Model Selection**
```python
from ml_pipeline_automation import ModelSelection

# Create a model selection object
model = ModelSelection("random_forest")

# Configure hyperparameters
model.configure_hyperparameters({"n_estimators": 100, "max_depth": 5})
```

**Model Deployment**
```python
from ml_pipeline_automation import ModelDeployment

# Create a model deployment object
deployment = ModelDeployment("aws", "cloud")

# Deploy the model
deployment.deploy(model)
```

**Troubleshooting**

For issues related to data ingestion, model selection, or deployment, refer to the package documentation or raise an issue on the repository.
