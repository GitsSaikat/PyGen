**Quantum Error Correction (QEC) Package: Mitigating Noise and Preserving Quantum Information Integrity**

**Overview**

This package is designed to automate the error detection and correction processes in quantum computing, ensuring the integrity of quantum information by mitigating the effects of noise. It provides a comprehensive framework for detecting and correcting errors that can occur during quantum computations, thereby enabling reliable and efficient quantum information processing.

**Key Features**

* **Error Detection**: The package implements a range of error detection techniques, including syndrome measurement, error correction codes, and machine learning-based approaches. These techniques enable the identification of errors that can occur during quantum computations, such as bit flip errors, phase errors, and more complex errors.
* **Error Correction**: Once errors are detected, the package provides a range of error correction techniques to mitigate their effects. These techniques include quantum error correction codes, such as surface codes, Shor codes, and topological codes, as well as more advanced techniques like concatenated codes and quantum error correction with machine learning.
* **Noise Modeling**: The package includes a range of noise models that simulate the effects of noise on quantum systems. These models enable the testing and validation of the error detection and correction techniques, ensuring that the package can effectively mitigate noise in a variety of scenarios.
* **Integration with Quantum Computing Frameworks**: The package is designed to integrate seamlessly with popular quantum computing frameworks, such as Qiskit, Cirq, and Q#. This enables users to leverage the package's error detection and correction capabilities within their existing quantum computing workflows.

circuit = qec.Circuit(qec.qubits(5))

# Add quantum gates to the circuit
circuit.x(0)
circuit.h(1)
circuit.cx(0, 1)

# Detect errors in the circuit
errors = ErrorDetection.detect_errors(circuit)

# Correct errors in the circuit
corrected_circuit = ErrorCorrection.correct_errors(circuit, errors)
```
