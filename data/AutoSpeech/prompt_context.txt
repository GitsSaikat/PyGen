Feature: Feature Extraction
Here's a concise summary of the feature extraction feature for an AutoML system:

**Feature Extraction**

Summary: Automatically extracts relevant features from raw data, enabling machine learning models to learn patterns and relationships more effectively. This feature helps simplify data preparation, identifies significant variables, and improves model accuracy.

Feature: Speaker Identification and Verification
**Speaker Identification and Verification Feature in an AutoML System**

This feature enables an AutoML system to accurately identify and verify speakers based on their unique voice characteristics. Key points of this feature include:

* **Voice Biometric Analysis**: The system analyzes audio inputs to extract unique speaker characteristics, such as tone, pitch, and cadence.
* **Speaker Enrollment and Profiling**: Users can enroll their voice profiles, which are stored in a database for future verification.
* **Verification Modes**: The system supports two modes: 
  1. **Text-Dependent Verification**: Speakers must say pre-defined phrases or passwords for verification.
  2. **Text-Independent Verification**: Speakers can say anything, and the system still verifies their identity.
* **High Accuracy and Security**: The feature uses advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure accurate speaker identification and verification, while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user voice profiles.

Feature: Speech Segmentation
**Speech Segmentation Feature in AutoML System**

The Speech Segmentation feature in an AutoML system enables automatic detection and separation of individual speech segments from an audio or video file. This feature is designed to automatically identify specific sections within audio or video recordings, such as speaker changes, pauses, or silence.
