 **Hello World, Welcome to PyGen!**
 

Imagine if turning your wildest ideas into software was as easy as asking for it‚Äîthat's what PyGen is all about! Whether you're a researcher, a tech enthusiast, or someone with a creative spark, PyGen helps turn abstract thoughts into real, functioning Python tools. With the power of advanced language models, PyGen makes coding simpler, faster, and more fun.

PyGen is like having a tech-savvy assistant who builds software for you. From an idea to a full-blown Python package‚Äîcomplete with testing and documentation‚ÄîPyGen does the heavy lifting. We've even built examples like AutoML (automated machine learning), AutoVision (computer vision), AutoSpeech, and tools for Quantum Error Correction to show what's possible.

PyGen is about making technology accessible to everyone, sharing knowledge, and bringing your ideas to life. This is just the beginning, and we can't wait to see how you use PyGen to shape the future!

> **Note:** Please use PyGen responsibly and make sure to test the generated code for safety and correctness.
