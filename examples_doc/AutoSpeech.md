## Overview
------------

AutoSpeech is an open-source Python package designed for speech processing and interpretation. It provides a comprehensive solution for speech data analysis, enabling developers to build intelligent applications that can understand and respond to spoken language.

The package is built around several key components:

1.  **Speech Preprocessing**: Tools for noise reduction, silence removal, and audio normalization.
2.  **Speech Recognition**: Machine learning algorithms for speech recognition, including deep neural networks (DNNs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs).
3.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques for speech interpretation, including part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
4.  **Word Embeddings**: Algorithms for semantic representation of words, such as Word2Vec and GloVe.
5.  **Real-time Processing**: Real-time speech processing and interpretation capabilities.

AutoSpeech aims to make speech processing and interpretation accessible to developers, researchers, and students, providing a simple and intuitive API for building applications that can understand and respond to spoken language.

## Installation
------------

To install AutoSpeech, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install autospeech
```

This command will download and install the package, along with all its dependencies.

## Usage
-----

The usage of AutoSpeech is simple and straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### Loading Audio Files

To load an audio file, use the `load_audio` function:

```python
import autospeech
audio_path = "example.wav"
audio_data = autospeech.load_audio(audio_path)
```

### Preprocessing Audio Data

To preprocess the audio data, use the `preprocess_audio` function:

```python
preprocessed_audio = autospeech.preprocess_audio(audio_data)
```

### Recognizing Speech

To recognize speech in the preprocessed audio data, use the `recognize_speech` function:

```python
recognized_speech = autospeech.recognize_speech(preprocessed_audio)
```

### Performing Natural Language Processing

To perform natural language processing on the recognized speech, use the `perform_nlp` function:

```python
nlp_result = autospeech.perform_nlp(recognized_speech)
```

### Putting it all Together

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the usage of AutoSpeech:

```python
import autospeech
audio_path = "example.wav"
audio_data = autospeech.load_audio(audio_path)
preprocessed_audio = autospeech.preprocess_audio(audio_data)
recognized_speech = autospeech.recognize_speech(preprocessed_audio)
nlp_result = autospeech.perform_nlp(recognized_speech)
print(nlp_result)
```

## Examples
-------

Here are some examples of using AutoSpeech:

*   **Speech Recognition**: Use AutoSpeech to recognize spoken words and phrases in audio files or real-time audio input.
*   **Natural Language Processing**: Apply AutoSpeech to perform sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and topic modeling on text transcripts.
*   **Real-time Processing**: Use AutoSpeech to build applications that can respond to spoken language in real-time.

You can find more examples in the `examples` directory of the package.

## API Reference
--------------

AutoSpeech provides the following API functions:

*   `load_audio` : Loads an audio file.
*   `preprocess_audio` : Preprocesses the audio data.
*   `recognize_speech` : Recognizes speech in the preprocessed audio data.
*   `perform_nlp` : Performs natural language processing on the recognized speech.

You can find more information about the API in the `docs` directory of the package.

## Testing
-------

AutoSpeech provides a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the package is working correctly.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_AutoSpeech.py
```

You can find more information about the tests in the `tests` directory of the package.

## Troubleshooting
------------------

If you encounter any issues while using AutoSpeech, you can refer to the troubleshooting guide in the `docs` directory of the package.
