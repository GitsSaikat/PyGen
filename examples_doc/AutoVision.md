### Overview

The AutoVision package is a comprehensive Python package designed to automate various visual data processing tasks. It provides a set of features for image preprocessing, object detection, segmentation, and classification. AutoVision aims to simplify and streamline the process of working with visual data, making it an ideal choice for application developers, researchers, and students.

With AutoVision, you can automate tasks such as image resizing, normalization, data augmentation, object detection, feature extraction, and image classification. The package also supports scalability and distributed vision processing, making it suitable for large-scale applications. Additionally, AutoVision provides explainability and visual analytics tools to help you gain insights into your visual data.

### Installation

To install AutoVision, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install AutoVision
```

Please ensure you have the required dependencies installed, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Additionally, you can also clone the AutoVision repository from GitHub and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/AutoVision.git
cd AutoVision
python setup.py install
```

### Usage Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the AutoVision package:

**Example 1: Image Preprocessing**

```python
import AutoVision as av

# Load an image
img = av.load_image('image.jpg')

# Apply image resizing
img = av.resize_image(img, (224, 224))

# Apply image normalization
img = av.normalize_image(img)

# Apply data augmentation
img = av.apply_data_augmentation(img)

# Display the preprocessed image
cv2.imshow('Preprocessed Image', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Example 2: Object Detection**

```python
import AutoVision as av
import cv2

# Load an image
img = av.load_image('image.jpg')

# Detect objects
objects = av.detect_objects(img)

# Draw bounding boxes around detected objects
for obj in objects:
    x, y, w, h, class_label = obj
    cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
    cv2.putText(img, class_label, (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (36,255,12), 2)

# Display the detected objects
cv2.imshow('Detected Objects', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Example 3: Image Classification**

```python
import AutoVision as av

# Load an image
img = av.load_image('image.jpg')

# Apply image preprocessing
img = av.preprocess_image(img)

# Extract features from the image
features = av.extract_features(img)

# Classify the image
class_label = av.classify_image(features)

# Print the classified label
print('Class label:', class_label)
```

### API Reference

The AutoVision package provides the following APIs:

* `load_image(img_path)`: Loads an image from a file path.
* `resize_image(img, target_size)`: Resizes an image to a specified size.
* `normalize_image(img)`: Normalizes an image by scaling pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
* `apply_data_augmentation(img)`: Applies random transformations to an image for data augmentation.
* `detect_objects(img)`: Detects objects in an image using a pre-trained model.
* `extract_features(img)`: Extracts features from an image using a pre-trained model.
* `classify_image(features)`: Classifies an image based on extracted features.

### Module Documentation

The AutoVision package consists of the following modules:

* `main.py`: Provides the core logic for the AutoVision package.
* `image_preprocessing.py`: Provides image preprocessing functions.
* `object_detection.py`: Provides object detection functions.
* `feature_extraction.py`: Provides feature extraction functions.

### Troubleshooting

* **Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AutoVision'"**

This error typically occurs when the package has not been installed correctly. Ensure you have installed the AutoVision package using pip or by cloning the repository and installing it manually.

* **Error: "TypeError: Cannot read negative values"**

This error typically occurs when you are trying to read an image file that is corrupted or has an incorrect format. Ensure you are working with high-quality image files and correct formats.

* **Error: "RuntimeError: CuNNDataParallel variables do not get removed correctly"**

This error typically occurs due to memory leaks or corruption when using modules like Torchvision. Try restarting the interpreter or ensuring that you have the latest device drivers installed.

### FAQs

* **Q: How do I install the AutoVision package?**

A: You can install the AutoVision package using pip or by cloning the repository and installing it manually.

* **Q: What are the supported image formats?**

A: The AutoVision package supports image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

* **Q: What pre-trained models are used for object detection and classification?**

A: AutoVision uses popular pre-trained models such as YOLOv3, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50.
