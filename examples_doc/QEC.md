qedc.stabilizer_code()

# Perform quantum error correction
qedc.surface_code()

# Perform error threshold estimation
qedc.shor_code()
```

## API Reference
-----------------

The Quantum Error Detection and Correction package provides the following API:

### QEDC Class

The `QEDC` class is the main class of the package. It provides methods for quantum error detection, quantum error correction, quantum noise modeling, and error threshold estimation.

*   `__init__(error_rate, num_rep)`: Initializes the `QEDC` object with the given error rate and number of repetitions.
*   `stabilizer_code()`: Performs quantum error detection using a stabilizer code.
*   `surface_code()`: Performs quantum error correction using a surface code.
*   `shor_code()`: Estimates the error threshold using a Shor code.

## main.py
-------------

The `main.py` file is the main entry point of the package. It demonstrates how to use the `QEDC` class to perform quantum error detection and correction.

Here's an example of how to use the `main.py` file:
```bash
python main.py
```

This command will perform quantum error detection and correction using the `QEDC` class.

## tests/test_QEDC.py
-------------------------

The `tests/test_QEDC.py` file contains unit tests for the `QEDC` class. It tests the following methods:

*   `test_quantum_error_detection()`: Tests the `stabilizer_code()` method.
*   `test_quantum_error_correction()`: Tests the `surface_code()` method.
*   `test_surface_code()`: Tests the `surface_code()` method.
*   `test_shor_code()`: Tests the `shor_code()` method.

Here's an example of how to run the tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_QEDC.py
```

This command will run the unit tests and report any failures.

## Quantum Error Detection and Correction/__init__.py
---------------------------------------------------

The `Quantum Error Detection and Correction/__init__.py` file initializes the package. It imports the `QEDC` class and provides a convenient way to use the package.

## examples/example_QEDC.py
---------------------------

The `examples/example_QEDC.py` file contains an example of how to use the `QEDC` class to perform quantum error detection and correction. It demonstrates how to create a `QEDC` object and use its methods to perform quantum error detection and correction.

Here's an example of how to use the `example_QEDC.py` file:
```bash
python examples/example_QEDC.py
```

This command will perform quantum error detection and correction using the `QEDC` class.

## Conclusion
----------

The Quantum Error Detection and Correction package is a powerful tool for detecting and correcting errors in quantum computations. It provides a range of features, including quantum error detection, quantum error correction, quantum noise modeling, and error threshold estimation. The package is easy to use and comes with several examples that demonstrate its features.
